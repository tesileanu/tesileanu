### Hi there ðŸ‘‹  

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a personal project combining my sleep, exercise, and glucose data.  
ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning advanced machine learning with Python.  
ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on data analysis and exploration projects.  
ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with learning the business side of data science.  
ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my projects or what I do in my spare time.  
ðŸ“« How to reach me: btesileanu@gmail.com OR http://tesileanu.github.io
